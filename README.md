# Diabetes Detection Web Application 🔎
This is a diabetes detection web application that uses machine learning to detect whether someone has diabetes that uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**. It utilzes the Streamlit libary.
## Dataset Used 📝
This dataset was derived from [Kaggle](https://support.west-wind.com). It is originally from the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases**. This will be used to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.  

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

### Predictor Values Include:
<ul>
    <li>Number of Pregnancies</li>
    <li>Body Mass Index(BMI)</li>
    <li>Insulin Level</li>
    <li>Age</li>
    <li>Blood Pressure</li>
    <li>Skin Thickness</li>
    <li>Diabetes Pedigree Function</li>
</ul>

## Machine Learning Models used ✨
<ul>
    <li><b>Logistic Regression  </li>
    <li>Random Forest Classifier</li>
    <li>K Nearest Neighbors </b></li>
    
</ul>
